# Modeling House Price Data Using Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale Family (GAMLSS)

This project explores the prediction of house prices using Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale Family (GAMLSS). The dataset contains various features, including house characteristics such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and age. The aim is to model the total value of houses based on these features, using different distributions (Log-Normal, Gamma, GB2, etc.) to determine the most appropriate model for the data. The process includes data cleaning, feature transformation, model fitting, and residual analysis to evaluate the performance of the models. Different approaches such as stepwise variable selection and varying the number of parameters are explored to improve model accuracy. The goal is to identify the best-fitting model that predicts house prices effectively.
